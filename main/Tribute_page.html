            <ul>
                <li><strong>1930</strong> - Yuan was born in Beijing, China on September 7, 1930 to Yuan Xinglie and Hua Jing. He was the second of six siblings.</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - He graduated from  Southwest Agricultural College and began teaching in Anjiang Agricultural School</li>
                <li><strong>1960s</strong> - Yuan had the idea of hybridizing rice to increase its yield after reading of similar research.</li>
                <li><strong>1961</strong> - He spotted a seed-head of wild hybrid rice.</li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> - Yuan hypothesized that naturally-mutated male-sterile rice could exist and could be used for the creation of new hybrid rice varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Beside a railway line in Hainan, he and his team found a particularly important wild variety.Using this one within a breeding programme resulted in varieties with yields improved by 20 - 30% in the late 1970s</li>
                <li><strong>1979</strong> -  His technique for hybrid rice was introduced into the United States, making it the first case of intellectual property rights transfer in the history of the People's Republic of China.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> -  Yuan advocated for sharing the success of his breakthroughs with other nations. He and his team donated crucial rice strains to the International Rice Research Institute</li>
                <li><strong>2021</strong> -  On March 10, 2021, Yuan collapsed at his hybrid rice research base in Sanya. At 13:07 on May 22, Yuan Longping died of multiple organ failure at the age of 90</li>
